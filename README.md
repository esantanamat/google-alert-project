# Smart Travel Reminder
## Inspiration

The idea for this project came while preparing ahead to leave for a destination. I noticed that Apple Maps provides an estimated departure time, but I wanted something more precise. Instead of relying on rough estimates, I decided to create a full-stack application that allows users to enter when they need to arrive somewhere, where they're going, and where they're coming from â€” and then receive a real-time reminder (via email) when it's time to leave. Note: This feature is available with Google Maps, and Calendar, but the idea was to create a feature that does not require a mobile application. I created this project to stay within the AWS Free tier for dev purposes.
